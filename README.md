First attempt at using somebody elses code in the form of a template, overcoming new challanges with every edit.

Can see from this point that the template chosen will not serve my purposes quite as well as I would have liked, however the learning process 
has been enlightening.

Initial feedback on the overall look and feel of the site is less than desireable at this time,
full redo of the site will be required, but the repo will remain as a lesson to my future self.

Static site for a mom and pop shop, handyman and cleaning service.
